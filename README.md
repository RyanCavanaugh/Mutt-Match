In this project the gulp file was set up previous by my teach, Jake Smith, at TIY. He is also responsible for the login and auth on this page.

This project was written predominantly in React and uses React Routers to change pages.

This app was designed with the idea that pets sometimes need new homes when their owners move or leave. So it is a way for their current owner to find their pet a new "perfect" home instead of taking them to the pound. It currently can create profiles and show all users on the site.
